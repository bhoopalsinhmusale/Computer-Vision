4 images have been provided:
swi.nii
tof.nii
t1.nii
t2.nii

you should focus primarily on the swi and the tof.

your job is to segment the arteries from the tof, and the veins from the swi
the veins are dark on the swi
the arteries are bright on the tof

swi images are designed to provide maximal contrast between veins and other tissue
tof images are designed to provide maximal contrast between arteries and other tissue

however, there are some veins visible on the tof, and some arteries visible on the swi
(due to imaging limitations)
bonus #3 addresses this, if you want to come up with a creative solution to eliminate
veins on the tof and arteries on the swi

you can use the information from all 4 images. the t1 and t2 may be useful if you want
to register all images into the same space, or use different contrasts to help segment
the veins/arteries. but you don't need the t1 or t2 to complete the assignment.
